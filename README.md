# Irudi

A micro CSS framework. Some basic CSS + a [grid](http://cobyism.com/gridism/).
Try the demo --> [DEMO](http://chroma-branding.github.io/irudi)

## Why?

When we design web layouts, we don't like to find code we don't know about. We love building with minimum possible resources.

< than 350 lines. You can't be so lazy man..

## How ?

### 1. Get the files

The easiest way to use Irudi in your project is via the [Bower](http://twitter.github.com/bower) package manager.

```sh
bower install irudi
```

### 2. What's inside?

The download includes Irudi's CSS, a bower file and an index.html as a starting point.

```
Irudi/
├── index.html
├── css/
│   └── main.css
└── bower_components/
    └── normalize-css
    └── gridism
 ```

### 3. Do

Start designing. Just that.

No Gulp. No Grunt. Want it ? Maybe soon
